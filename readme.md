## Important

I invested my time and skills to make this program useful for designers as a way to accelerate and simplify the creative work process, share something meaningful with the world. But this software is more than just code — it’s a story of love, strength, and hope.

For several years now, my wife [Katya](https://www.instagram.com/krasnova_kat) has been fighting triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) with incredible courage — enduring chemotherapy, surgeries, and long recoveries. She is my inspiration in life and in work.

When you use this tool, you’re not just using a tool — you’re becoming part of our journey.

If you find value in this program, please consider making a donation. Your support allows me to continue developing this tool, and at the same time helps us face the daily challenges of her treatment and healing.

Every contribution, big or small, is a message of solidarity and love.
Together, we can turn creativity into kindness. ❤️
